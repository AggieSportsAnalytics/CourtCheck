# CourtCheck Tennis Project üéæ

## üèÅ Automate tennis match analysis using the power of computer vision.

The CourtCheck Tennis Project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to accurately track tennis ball movements and court boundaries in tennis matches. This project aims to provide real-time insights and automated decision-making in tennis, reducing human error and enhancing the accuracy of in/out calls. The project integrates Python, machine learning, and computer vision to create a seamless and efficient system for tennis match analysis.

## üîë Key Features

### Court Detection

The project employs keypoint detection algorithms to identify and track the tennis court's boundaries, ensuring accurate mapping and analysis of the court's dimensions.

- Uses Detectron2 for keypoint detection and court boundary identification.

### Ball Tracking

The system uses a deep learning model to track the tennis ball's position throughout the match, allowing for precise in/out call determinations.

- Utilizes a custom-trained TrackNet model for ball detection and tracking.

### 2D Court Simulation

One of the critical aspects of the project is transforming the detected ball and court positions onto a 2D map, enabling a clear and concise view of the ball's trajectory and court boundaries.

- Implements perspective transform using OpenCV.
- Transforms detected keypoints and ball positions to a 2D representation for easy analysis.
