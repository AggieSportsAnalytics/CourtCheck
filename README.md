### üèÅ Automate tennis match analysis using the power of computer vision.

The CourtCheck Tennis Project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to accurately track tennis ball movements and court boundaries in tennis matches. This project aims to provide real-time insights and automated decision-making in tennis, reducing human error and enhancing the accuracy of in/out calls. The project integrates Python, machine learning, and computer vision to create a seamless and efficient system for tennis match analysis.

# üîë Key Features



## üîé Court Detection

The project employs keypoint detection algorithms to identify and track the tennis court's boundaries, ensuring accurate mapping and analysis of the court's dimensions.

### üìë Annotation

We started by annotating images using OpenCV in the COCO format, generating JSON files for each annotated image. The OpenCV Annotation Tool has a fantastic interface to annotate images and export them in different formats. It also features a great interpolation tool that allows the use of a skeleton, enabling the labeling of key frames that can be interpolated and applied over consecutive frames in the video.

Below is an overview of the Detectron2 architecture:

</div>


Each label in the skeleton represents a keypoint on the tennis court, identifying an important corner or intersection of lines that are crucial for the overall court detection when training the model. Here are the keypoints and their corresponding labels:

| Keypoint | Label                       | Keypoint | Label                           | Keypoint | Label                       |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| BTL      | Bottom Top Left             | ITM      | Inner Top Middle                | ITR      | Inner Top Right             |
| BTLI     | Bottom Top Left Inner       | IBR      | Inner Bottom Right              | NL       | Net Left                    |
| BTRI     | Bottom Top Right Inner      | NR       | Net Right                       | BBL      | Bottom Bottom Left          |

### ü§ñ Training the Model

Leveraging the GPUs available in Google Colab, we trained the Detectron2 model. The model was configured to detect and classify the key points of the tennis court from the annotated images.

Below is an overview of the Detectron2 architecture:

<img src="https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/CourtCheck/blob/cory/images/detectron2_architecture.png" alt="Detectron2 Architecture" width="800"/>

Below is a summary of the code used for training the model in Google Colab:

```python
# Register the dataset
for d in ["train", "val"]:
    DatasetCatalog.register("tennis_" + d, lambda d=d: get_tennis_dicts("path/to/your/" + d))
    MetadataCatalog.get("tennis_" + d).set(thing_classes=["court"])

# Configure the model
cfg = get_cfg()
cfg.merge_from_file(model_zoo.get_config_file("COCO-Keypoints/keypoint_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml"))
cfg.DATASETS.TRAIN = ("tennis_train",)
cfg.DATASETS.TEST = ()
cfg.DATALOADER.NUM_WORKERS = 2
cfg.MODEL.WEIGHTS = model_zoo.get_checkpoint_url("COCO-Keypoints/keypoint_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml")
cfg.SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH = 2
cfg.SOLVER.BASE_LR = 0.00025
cfg.SOLVER.MAX_ITER = 1000
cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE = 128
cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NUM_CLASSES = 1  # only has one class (court)
cfg.MODEL.KEYPOINT_ON = True

# Train the model
os.makedirs(cfg.OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)
trainer = DefaultTrainer(cfg)
trainer.resume_or_load(resume=False)
trainer.train()
```

## Ball Tracking

The system uses a deep learning model to track the tennis ball's position throughout the match, allowing for precise in/out call determinations.

- Utilizes a custom-trained TrackNet model for ball detection and tracking.

**_The yellow circle represents the detected position of the tennis ball._**

## 2D Court Simulation

One of the critical aspects of the project is transforming the detected ball and court positions onto a 2D map, enabling a clear and concise view of the ball's trajectory and court boundaries.

- Implements perspective transform using OpenCV.
- Transforms detected keypoints and ball positions to a 2D representation for easy analysis.
