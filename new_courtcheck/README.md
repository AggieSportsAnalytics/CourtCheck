# üè∏ CourtCheck

CourtCheck is an end-to-end tennis match analysis tool that uses computer vision and machine learning to automatically generate visual and statistical insights from raw match footage. Built in collaboration with the **UC Davis Men's and Women's Tennis Teams**, the goal of this project is to make post-match film review faster, smarter, and more objective ‚Äî without requiring manual tagging or expensive equipment.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Automate the analysis of full-length tennis match videos
- Provide coaches and players with **immediate visualizations** (e.g. heatmaps, bounce locations, player movement)
- Reduce human error and subjective judgment in ball calls or movement assessment
- Offer a **scalable, cloud-based workflow** that can handle long videos efficiently (Google Colab, A100 GPU)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Recent Optimizations

CourtCheck has recently undergone major optimizations to improve scalability and efficiency for long tennis match videos:

**Optimizations Already Made:**

- **Frame Streaming:** The script now reads frames one-by-one using `cv2.VideoCapture` instead of loading all frames into memory.
- **Frame Subsampling:** Detectors are only run every N frames (`FRAME_PROCESSING_INTERVAL`), reducing compute.
- **Conditional Drawing:** Drawing and video writing are only performed if `ENABLE_DRAWING` is True.
- **Detector Refactoring:** Ball, court, and person detectors are adapted to work on single frames or small buffers.
- **Efficient Main Loop:** The main loop collects results for each frame, using the last processed result for skipped frames, and post-processing (bounce detection, heatmaps) is performed at the end.
- **Memory Efficiency:** The script is now much more memory- and compute-efficient, suitable for long videos.

## üöß What's Left To Do

- **Robust Player Tracking:** The current person detection logic only detects persons per frame and splits by court half, but does not robustly track or re-identify individual players across frames.
- **Unique Player IDs:** Need to implement a fast, accurate person detector (e.g., YOLO) combined with a multi-object tracker (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT, ByteTrack) to assign persistent, unique IDs to each player throughout the match.
- **Integrate New Detector/Tracker:** Replace the current `PersonDetector` with a YOLO+tracker solution, and update the main loop to use the new output for minimap drawing and analytics.
- **Player Labeling:** Assign "Player 1" and "Player 2" labels to the tracked IDs, and maintain this mapping even if players switch sides.

## üß† How CourtCheck Works

CourtCheck integrates several specialized models to process and annotate match footage:

| Component           | Model / Technique           | Function                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| üéæ Court Detection  | Detectron2 (keypoint R-CNN) | Detects court boundaries and reference points |
| üü° Ball Tracking    | Custom CNN (TrackNet-style) | Predicts ball coordinates across frames       |
| ‚õ≥ Bounce Detection | CatBoost ML model           | Identifies when and where the ball bounces    |
| üßç Player Detection | Faster R-CNN (PyTorch)      | Locates and tracks players on both sides      |
| üîú Stroke Detection | _(Planned)_                 | Will classify serve, forehand, backhand, etc. |

These outputs are then used to generate:

- Minimap overlays
- Trajectory visualizations
- Heatmaps (bounce, player movement)
- Analytics outputs for coaching and feedback

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, CatBoost
- Detectron2 (court keypoints), custom CNN (TrackNet), torchvision models (Faster R-CNN)
- Google Colab (A100 GPU) for GPU-accelerated inference and post-processing
- Scene detection via PySceneDetect

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Set paths to your input video (MP4) and model weights in the script
2. Run `process_video.py` on **Google Colab with GPU enabled**
3. Optionally adjust:
   - `ENABLE_VISUALIZATION = False` to speed up runs
   - Frame rate downsampling
   - Input resolution (default: 640√ó360)

---

## üìä Output Formats

- `video.mp4` with overlays (if enabled)
- `minimap.mp4` showing real-time positions
- `bounce_heatmap.png`, `player_heatmap.png`
- (Planned) `analytics.csv` with summary stats per match
