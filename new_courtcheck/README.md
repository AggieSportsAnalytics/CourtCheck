# CourtCheck

## Overview

CourtCheck is an innovative project leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to automate and enhance tennis match analysis. Designed specifically for the UC Davis Men's and Women's Tennis Teams, CourtCheck significantly streamlines and enhances traditional film review processes by offering automated, precise analytics and engaging visualizations.

## Purpose

Traditional tennis match analysis is highly time-consuming, often requiring extensive manual review of hours-long footage. CourtCheck addresses this challenge by providing a cloud-based platform where coaches and players can conveniently upload match recordings. Leveraging powerful cloud computing resources, CourtCheck swiftly processes videos and automatically generates comprehensive player analytics and visual insights.

## How It Works

CourtCheck integrates five specialized machine learning models to deliver a thorough analysis of tennis matches:

- **Court Detection:** Utilizes neural network models (Detectron2) to accurately identify tennis court boundaries and critical court points.
- **Ball Detection:** Employs advanced deep learning techniques (TrackNet) to precisely track the tennis ball's trajectory throughout matches.
- **Bounce Detection:** Applies CatBoost machine learning models to detect exact ball bounce locations on the court, enhancing match accuracy.
- **Person Detection:** Identifies and tracks player positions and movements, providing detailed heatmaps and insights into player dynamics.
- **Stroke Detection (Upcoming):** Will classify and analyze tennis strokes (e.g., forehand, backhand, serve) to deliver deeper insights into player techniques and strategic play.

## Key Features

- **Cloud-Based Platform:** Users upload match footage directly through a website, which is then processed automatically using cloud computing resources.
- **Comprehensive Analytics:** Generate actionable, detailed player insights and strategic statistics quickly and accurately.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Provide intuitive and engaging visual analytics, such as heatmaps and ball trajectory visualizations.

## Impacts

- Drastically reduces manual video analysis time, allowing coaches and players to focus more effectively on training and strategic development.
- Minimizes human error and subjective biases by providing precise, data-driven analytics.
- Significantly improves training effectiveness and strategic decision-making through clear, actionable insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch (TrackNet, Detectron2)
- OpenCV for image processing and visualization
- CatBoost for bounce detection
- Google Colab for GPU-accelerated computing
- Cloud computing platforms for scalable deployment
