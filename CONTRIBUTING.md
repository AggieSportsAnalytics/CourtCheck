### Setting Up GitHub Actions for Syncing

Create a `.github/workflows/sync.yml` file with the following content to automate syncing between Google Drive and GitHub:

```yaml
name: Sync with Google Drive

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Runs every hour

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Google Drive Sync
        run: |
          # Install rclone
          curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
          
          # Configure rclone with Google Drive
          rclone config create remote drive config_is_local false
          
          # Sync Google Drive to repository
          rclone sync remote:your-google-drive-folder ./your-local-folder

      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git add .
          git commit -m "Sync with Google Drive"
          git push origin main
