# TrackNet
<i> It's not an official implementation </i> <br>
**Tracknet** is a deep learning network for tracking the tennis ball from broadcast videos in which the ball images are small, blurry, and sometimes even invisible. TrackNet takes multiple consecutive frames as input, model will learn not only object tracking but also trajectory to enhance its capability of positioning and recognition.TrackNet generates gaussian heat map centered on ball to indicate position of the ball.

## Architecture

## Dataset
Dataset consists of video clips of 10 broadcast video. Each video contains several clips from ball serving to score. There are 19.835 labeled frames in the dataset. The resolution, frame rate are 1280Ã—720, 30 fps respectively. In the label file, each frame may have the following attributes: "Frame Name", "Visibility Class", "X", "Y", and "Trajectory Pattern".

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/yastrebksv/TrackNet.git`
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install packages required. 
3. Run `python gt_gen.py <args>` to create ground truth images and train/test labels.
4. Prepare dataset to the following format:
```
datasets/trackNet
    /images
        /game1
            /Clip1
                /0000.jpg
                ...
                /0206.jpg
            ...
            /Clip13
                /0000.jpg
                ...
                /0252.jpg
        ...
        /game10
    /gts
        /game1
            /Clip1
                /0000.jpg
                ...
                /0206.jpg
            ...
            /Clip13
                /0000.jpg
                ...
                /0252.jpg
        ...
        /game10
    /labels_train.csv
    /labels_val.csv
```
5. Run `python main.py` to start training
